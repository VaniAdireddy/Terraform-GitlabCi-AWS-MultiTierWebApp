# üöÄ **Automated AWS Multi-Tier Web Application Architecture with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project automates the provisioning of a **Multi-Tier Web Application Architecture** on AWS using **Terraform** for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and **GitLab CI/CD** for seamless infrastructure deployment pipelines. 

The GitLab pipeline ensures infrastructure validation, planning, and deployment with manual approvals, adhering to best practices for controlled and automated cloud provisioning.

---

## **Architecture Details**

The infrastructure is divided into reusable Terraform modules to enhance modularity and scalability.

### **1. Network_VPC Module** üåê  
Provision and manage the network resources:
   - **VPC** with 2 Public and 2 Private Subnets  
   - **Internet Gateway** and Route Table Associations  
   - **Security Groups**:
     - Load Balancer: Allows HTTP traffic on port 80.  
     - EC2: Allows inbound traffic from Load Balancer Security Group.  
     - RDS: Allows traffic from EC2 Security Group (port 3306).  
   - **Outputs**: VPC ID, Subnet IDs, Security Group IDs for cross-module usage.

---

### **2. WebServer Module** üíª  
Manages the compute resources and application deployment:
   - **EC2 Instances** with **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** and Launch Templates.  
   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute HTTP traffic to EC2 instances.  
   - **User Data**:  
     - Leverages `deploy_app.sh` (base64-encoded) to configure and deploy the application on EC2 instances.  
   - **Outputs**: ASG Name, Security Group IDs, and ALB details.

---

### **3. Database Module** üóÑÔ∏è  
Provisions the RDS database for application storage:
   - **RDS Instance**:  
     - Deployed in Private Subnets for enhanced security.  
     - Listens on **port 3306** (MySQL) with security group rules restricting access to EC2 instances.  
   - **Outputs**: Database Host, Username, Password, Port, and DB Identifier for use in the WebServer module.

---

### **4. Monitoring Module** üìä  
Integrates monitoring and alerting:
   - **CloudWatch Alarms**:  
     - Monitors **EC2 CPU utilization** and **RDS storage usage**.  
   - **SNS Notifications**:  
     - Configured to notify via email for critical CloudWatch alerts.

---

## **State Management**  
Terraform backend uses **S3 for remote state storage** and **DynamoDB for state locking** to ensure data consistency across deployments.

---

## **CI/CD Pipeline with GitLab** üõ†Ô∏è  

The GitLab CI/CD pipeline automates the Terraform workflow using the following stages:

1. **Before Script**:  
   - Install required Terraform version.  
   - Run `terraform init` for module initialization.

2. **Pipeline Stages**:
   - **Terraform Validate**: Syntax and configuration validation.  
   - **Terraform Plan**: Review planned changes (no impact).  
   - **Terraform Apply** (Manual Approval): Deploy the infrastructure after approval.  
   - **Terraform Destroy** (Manual): Destroy resources when needed.

---

## **Deployment Steps** üöÄ

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following tools installed:  
   - Terraform  
   - GitLab account  
   - AWS CLI  
   - Git  

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd project-1
```

### **Setup Environment Variables**
Export the following environment variables for secure authentication:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-access-key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret-key>
```

### **Initialize Terraform**
```bash
terraform init
```

### **Validate the Configuration**
```bash
terraform validate
```

### **Plan the Infrastructure**
```bash
terraform plan
```

### **Deploy the Infrastructure**
```bash
terraform apply
```
*For GitLab Pipeline*: Push changes to the repository to trigger automated validation and deployment.

## **Key Features** üîë

- **High Availability**:  
  - Multi-tier architecture using Auto Scaling Groups and RDS deployed in private subnets.

- **Modular Design**:  
  - Infrastructure is organized into reusable modules for **Network_VPC**, **WebServer**, **Database**, and **Monitoring**.

- **Security Best Practices**:  
  - Private Subnets for RDS, restricted Security Groups, and IAM roles.  

- **Monitoring Integration**:  
  - CloudWatch Alarms and SNS for proactive alerting.

- **CI/CD Integration**:  
  - GitLab CI/CD automates validation, planning, and provisioning.

---

## **Technologies Used** üõ†Ô∏è  

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure-as-Code for AWS provisioning.  
- **AWS Services**:  
   - EC2, RDS, VPC, ASG, ALB, CloudWatch, SNS.  
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Automation for Terraform workflows.  
- **S3 & DynamoDB**: Remote state and locking for consistency.  

---

## **Challenges Faced** üß©  
- **State Management**: Ensuring consistency using S3 and DynamoDB for locking state files.  
- **Networking**: Setting up secure private and public subnets while managing route table associations.  
- **Automation**: Implementing a controlled CI/CD pipeline with manual approvals for Terraform `apply` and `destroy`.
